vertx-whiteboard
================

A vertx demo of a collaborative whiteboard.

This idea was copied from an IBM MQTT demo, entitled ["Developing dynamic, collaborative mobile applications with MQ Telemetry Transport"](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/mobile-solutions/worklight/docs/v610/11_09_Developing_dynamic_collaborative_mobile_applications_with_MQTT.pdf).

Clone the project and run it using the included Gradle wrapper ("./gradlew runMod").
